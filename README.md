# Exploding Eyes
A Minecraft datapack that creates explosions everywhere you look.  
This challenge is extremely annoying, so attempt at your own risk.

## Installation
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/TWS2401/exploding-eyes/releases)
- Locate your world's datapack folder (`.minecraft/saves/[your_world_name]/datapacks`)
- Place the datapack into the datapack folder
- Make sure the datapack is enabled by using `/datapack list`. If it isn't, enable it with `/datapack enable "file/exploding-eyes.zip"`
